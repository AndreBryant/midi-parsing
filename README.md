# MIDI Parsing in TypeScript

Implementation of a simple MIDI Parser in TypeScript.

Reference: [Standard MIDI File Structure](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~craig/14q/midifile/MidiFileFormat.html)

## Getting Started

Visit `src/index.ts` and make changes to see how the parser works (I added comments as guide).

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
